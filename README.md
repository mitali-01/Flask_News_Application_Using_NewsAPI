## Code Explanation:
### `app.py`
- **Flask Setup**: Initializes the Flask app and loads the necessary dependencies.
- **NewsAPI Client**: Fetches the top headlines from various sources specified in the sources parameter of the `get_top_headlines()` function.
- **Rendering News**: The fetched articles are processed and passed to the HTML template for rendering.
### `news.html`
- Displays the top headlines in a responsive card layout.
- Each article is displayed with the title, description, image (if available), and a link to read more.
### `style.css`
- Defines the styles for the page, including the card layout for each article, and the footer.
- Uses Flexbox to display the news articles in a grid.
## Future Improvements
- Add a search functionality to find news articles by keywords.
- Implement pagination for displaying a large number of articles.
- Add user authentication for a personalized experience.
- Improve styling and UI for a more polished look.
